This archive is for sources of various types:

1. Publishing source clips from Rebol 2.7.8 that could be integrated back into the new Rebol. If you're interested, do it.
2. Code used for test cases that should be kept close to the Rebol source. (It's been a tendency in the past to lose track of such code. Putting it here also makes it easy to improve over time or hyperlink.)
3. Other code and/or files that shouldn't be lost. Examples might be the source code to Rebol/IOS and its apps, etc.
